summary: '"Feathers Left Around" by Carolyn Wells is a collection of detective stories
  written in the early 20th century. The stories follow Fleming Stone, a clever American
  detective known for his ingenuity and skill in unraveling mysteries, as he encounters
  various baffling cases. This work promises to engage readers with intriguing plots
  that challenge the intellect, inviting them into a world of suspense and deduction.  The
  opening of the book introduces readers to the character of Valentine Loft and his
  guests enjoying a weekend at his Westchester estate, where a lively discussion about
  methods of murder ensues. The light-hearted conversation takes a dark turn when
  Loft''s guest, the author Hugh Curran, is found dead in his locked room under mysterious
  circumstances. As Loft grapples with the shocking discovery, the tension among the
  assembled guests rises, leading to a mix of curiosity and dread. This intriguing
  start hints at a complex interplay of motives and suspects, setting the stage for
  a compelling murder mystery. (This is an automatically generated summary.)'
